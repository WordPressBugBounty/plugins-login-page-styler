### Limit Login Attempts
This plugin includes a powerful **Limit Login Attempts** feature, designed to protect your site from brute force attacks. By restricting the number of login attempts from a single IP address, you can significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access. After exceeding the allowed attempts, users will be temporarily locked out, ensuring that only legitimate users can log in.

### Custom Login Redirect
With the **Custom Login Redirect** feature, you can effortlessly control where users are directed after a successful login. Whether you want to send them to a specific page or the dashboard, this plugin allows you to set a personalized redirect URL. This feature enhances user experience by directing them to relevant content immediately upon logging in.

### Custom Login Menu
The **Custom Login Menu** feature enables you to customize the navigation options . You can choose to show Login inside  primarny menu of your site . This customization helps to guide users to essential pages without cluttering the interface.

### Custom Login URL
Say goodbye to the default WordPress login URL with our **Custom Login URL** feature. This functionality allows you to set a unique login URL for your site, enhancing security by obscuring the standard login path. A custom login URL makes it more challenging for potential attackers to locate your login page while also allowing you to tailor the experience to your site's branding.

### Login Protected Site
Our plugin offers a **Login Protected Site** feature, allowing you to restrict access to your entire site. Only users who can successfully log in will have access to your content, ensuring that sensitive information is shielded from unauthorized visitors. This feature is particularly useful for membership sites, private communities, or any site requiring enhanced security measures.

### Harness the Power of Google reCAPTCHA :
This plugin leverages Google reCAPTCHA, a formidable security tool, to fend off automated spam submissions and bolster login page security. By integrating Google reCAPTCHA on the login page, you ensure that only genuine individuals can access your site, enhancing overall login security.
